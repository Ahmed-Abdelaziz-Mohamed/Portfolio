Hello everyone,

I created this template using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Navbar: The navbar includes a scroll spy feature with color changes when the user scrolls through the webpage.
This is achieved with a bit of JavaScript.
Home Section: You will see a text animation for the name and titles.
About Me Section: I added a subtle effect using small repeated dots under the section title and other headings throughout the template. You can also upload your CV here to make it downloadable.
Portfolio Section: There are navs & tabs that allow users to switch between different portfolio items.
Our Team Section: Iâ€™ve used a creative layout to showcase each team member in a visually appealing way.
Contact Section: The template also includes a contact form.
I hope you find it useful!

Thanks for checking it out! ðŸ˜Š
